# EAS Frame attestations

Frame actions are not captured in the hub right now, so I want to enable ethereum "log" like behavior for frames that need them.

This frame repo allows you to store actions in the "frameAction" EAS schema either onchain or offchain.

Useful for:
- generally storing past frames data for composabillity/access
- pushing action data onchain for stuff like "reserving" a mint
- ???
